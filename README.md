# Neutrino_Oscillations
A physics simulation that uses 3D minimisation techniqutes to fit the expected oscillations of neutrinos to real data. 

It contains a parabolic minimiser in one dimension, a univariate method which implments the paraoblic minimiser in more than one dimension, and also a method to calculate the error in each method. 

A simulated annealing method to search for a global minimum is implimented with a test function showing the validation of the code, as well as plots that show that the extracted parameters for neutrino oscillations match well with the data taken from the T2K experiment.
